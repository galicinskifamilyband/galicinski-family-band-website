      MUSIC.  MISSIONS. MINISTRY.


      God has impressed these three words on their hearts. 


      To use the beauty and power of music to reach deep into your heart and
      inspire you to seek first the Kingdom of God.  


      The Galicinski Family takes their love for Scottish Fiddle and mashes it
      up with a twist of rock and dance. A large family of 12 living just
      outside of Nashville, TN invites you to join them on their musical journey
      as they play and create new music.


      "Our hope is to inspire ***you*** to consider ***your*** family’s mission.
      And for you to prayerfully pursue those goals so that this next generation
      of Christ followers will come alongside God and impact the world for
      Jesus."


      His ultimate goal. His sacrificed life. 


      The Ultimate gift. My surrendered life.

      <h2>Reaching the Heart of Zambia</h2>

      <p>After reading <a
      href="https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B004U7HRT6&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_nDb6FbHKREKV2&tag=galicinskifam-20"
      target="_blank">Kisses from Katie</a>, and listening to the <a
      href="https://brinkmanadventures.com/" target="_blank">Brinkman
      Adventures</a> radio dramas, God gave us a deep desire to be more involved
      "on the ground" in missions.  In 2016, the Lord opened the doors for our
      family to start a new outreach ministry in Zambia to the poorest of the
      poor in the heart of Zambia.</p>

      <p>We had the opprotunity to fly over to get a first hand experience of
      Zambia, the orphan home and a new Christian school that was starting.  We
      fell in love with Zambia and the people.  During our trip, the Lord
      provided beyond what was expected and we were able to help take the
      ministry to the next level.</p>

      <p>Today, we have an awesome team of passionate followers of Christ who
      are dedicated to the ministry.  It is a Gospel-focused ministry that loves
      and gives hope to abandoned children in the heart of Zambia through the
      Gospel of Jesus Christ, empowering the next generation to break the chains
      of poverty.</p>

      <p>By faith and through your donations, we provide: <ul>  
        <li>free Christian school for poor children</li>
        <li>feeding program for impoverished children</li>
        <li>soccer outreach to community</li>
        <li>sustainability programs through business & farming projects</li>
        <li>fresh water wells</li>
        <li>Jesus Film gospel outreach to unreached villages</li>
        <li>church planting to unreached villages</li>
        <li>purity conferences for young adults</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Our goal is for all 250 children at the school to be matched with a
      sponsor, so that our programs have the funding needed to grow.  Would you
      pray about sponsoring a child for $38/month or giving a gift to support
      this work?  Go to <a
